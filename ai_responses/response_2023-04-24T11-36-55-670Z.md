This code defines four commands (`optimizeFile`, `addComments`, `writeTests`, and `howCanI`) that interact with the OpenAI API to assist with code optimization, adding comments to code, writing tests, and providing instructions for optimization. 

The `getActiveEditorContent()` function retrieves the content of the currently active editor, while the `getUserInput()` function prompts the user to provide additional input for the `howCanI` command. 

The `sendPromptToOpenAI()` function takes a `prompt` string and sends it to the OpenAI API for processing. It also creates a timestamped file with the AI's response to the prompt, saves it to the `ai_responses` folder in the current workspace, and opens the file for preview.

The `activate()` function registers each command with Visual Studio Code and pushed each command's disposable instance to `context.subscriptions`. 

Finally, the module exports `activate()` and `deactivate()` functions that are called when the extension is activated and deactivated, respectively.
